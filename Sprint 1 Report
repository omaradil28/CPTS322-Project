## What's New (User Facing)
 * Quiz Question Creation
 * Initialize project structure with Flask backend and React frontend
 * Account creation
 * Core of Website


## Work Summary (Developer Facing)


For Quiz Questions, the work was challenging at first as the groundwork was laid out in c++ but then had to be translated into python but after that hurdle it was successfully developed and added to the project. For account creation, the feature was developed through increments of work, with each stage focusing on certain necessities. At the same time, we ensured the feature met user needs by reviewing user stories and acceptance criteria to confirm they exist within our work. For initializing the project structure and setting up the React and Flask framework the main decision was selecting the best frameworks and getting a simple and easy to build off of start. I created an app.py file that handles the backend and then App.js and App.css for the frontend. For the website I did a standard html student dashboard and teacher dashboard and just hardcoded for the classes and grades for now to show it works. It took me some time to style it the way it would be easiest to read.
