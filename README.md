ClassRespond: An Interactive Classroom Response System <br />
<br />
ClassRespond is an interactive classroom response system that enables real-time
feedback and participation during lectures. The system will allow instructors to pose
questions, conduct polls, and receive instant responses from students using their mobile
devices or laptops. A database will store response data, participation records, and quiz
results. Integration with presentation software and learning management systems will
ensure seamless operation during classes, enhancing student engagement and allowing
instructors to immediately gauge understanding and adjust their teaching accordingly.
xxiv. HackAssign: A HackerRank-Style Mini Assignment Submission Platform
HackAssign is an online platform designed for submitting and evaluating coding
assignments, modeled after competitive programming platforms like HackerRank. The
system will allow instructors to create coding challenges, and students to submit their
solutions for automatic evaluation. A database will store assignment details,
submissions, and grading results. Integration with learning management systems will
streamline the assignment submission process and provide students with immediate
feedback on their code performance, helping them to improve their coding skills in a
structured environment.
